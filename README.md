# 🌍 World Indicator Analysis – API Live Integration Dashboard
API-driven live Power BI dashboard for real-time analysis of global socio-economic indicators using Python and World Bank data.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **live, automated, and interactive dashboard** for analyzing global socio-economic indicators using **Python and Power BI**.

The dashboard is powered by a **publicly available global API** that is regularly updated. A Python-based data pipeline automatically extracts, cleans, and processes the data, which is then **directly connected to Power BI via a live data connection**. As new data becomes available, the dashboard refreshes automatically—**no manual downloads or refresh actions are required**.

This project demonstrates how **API integration, automation, and business intelligence tools** can be combined to deliver real-time, scalable insights for global analysis.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The dashboard is designed to answer key analytical questions, including:

1. **Global Baseline Assessment**

   * Understand the overall economic and social landscape using average indicators such as GDP per capita, trade value, health expenditure, GDP growth, and forest area.

2. **Regional Health Spending Comparison**

   * Compare health expenditure (% of GDP) across world regions to identify disparities and policy differences.

3. **Socio-Economic Trends Over Time**

   * Analyze long-term trends in GDP, internet and mobile subscriptions, renewable energy usage, forest area, and unemployment.

4. **Internet Access & Immunization Awareness**

   * Evaluate whether higher internet penetration is associated with improved immunization rates.

5. **Internet Access & Unemployment**

   * Assess the role of digital connectivity in reducing unemployment levels.

6. **Poverty Reduction Performance**

   * Identify the **bottom 10 countries** with the least progress in poverty reduction.
   * Identify the **top 10 countries** with the most significant poverty reduction improvements.

7. **Health Indicator Relationships**

   * Examine interrelationships among health expenditure, life expectancy, immunization rates, child mortality, and disease burden.

8. **Government Health Spending vs Life Expectancy**

   * Analyze whether increased public health expenditure translates into higher life expectancy.
